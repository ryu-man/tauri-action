# Tauri GitHub Action

This GitHub Action builds your Web application as a Tauri native binary for MacOS, Linux and Windows.
If your project doesn't include the Tauri files, we create it at compile time, so if you don't need to use Tauri's API, you can just ship native apps through this Action.

# Usage

This GitHub Action has three main usages: test the build pipeline of your Tauri app, uploading Tauri artifacts to an existing release, and creating a new release with the Tauri artifacts.

## Testing the Build

```yml
name: "test-on-pr"
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test-tauri:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-20.04, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: setup node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - name: install Rust stable
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        toolchain: stable
    - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
      if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-20.04'
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
    - name: install app dependencies and build it
      run: yarn && yarn build
    - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Creating a release and uploading the Tauri bundles

```yml
name: "publish"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-20.04, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: setup node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - name: install Rust stable
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        toolchain: stable
    - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
      if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-20.04'
      run: |

        sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
    - name: install app dependencies and build it
      run: yarn && yarn build
    - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version
        releaseName: "App v__VERSION__"
        releaseBody: "See the assets to download this version and install."
        releaseDraft: true
        prerelease: false
```

## Uploading the artifacts to a release

```yml

# Caveats

- You can use this Action on a repo that doesn't have Tauri configured. We automatically initialize Tauri before building, and configure it to use your Web artifacts.
  - You can configure Tauri with the `configPath`, `distPath` and `iconPath` options.
- You can run custom Tauri CLI scripts with the `tauriScript` option. So instead of running `yarn tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>` or `npx tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>`, we'll execute `${tauriScript} <COMMAND> <ARGS>`.
  - Useful when you need custom build functionality when creating Tauri apps e.g. a `desktop:build` script.
- If you want to add additional arguments to the build command, you can use the `args` option. For example, if you're setting a specific target for your build, you can specify `args: --target your-target-arch`.
- When your app isn't on the root of the repo, use the `projectPath` input.
